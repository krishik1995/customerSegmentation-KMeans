Customer Segmentation for Mall data using K-Means

Background:

Customer segmentation is important for businesses to understand their target audience. Different advertisements can be curated and sent to different audience segments based on their demographic profile, interests, and affluence level.

There are many unsupervised machine learning algorithms that can help companies identify their user base and create consumer segments.

In this project, we will be looking at a popular unsupervised learning technique called K-Means clustering.
